#### Description
Provide a comprehensive set of software and emulated hardware that enables a person to run Confidential Computing on Arm. This should be done through the usage of Realms without the need to have access to real hardware.

This will involve the provision of full system emulation capable of running the Realms Management Extension (RME) as defined by the Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) specification, alongside all the software to run a full Confidential Computing solution on Arm (firmware, operating system, system libraries, virtualization management, and confidential virtual machine images).
